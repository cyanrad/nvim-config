# intro
this is essentially my log while trying to learn neovim as a dev environment
currently there are a bunch of things that would be great to have including but not limited to:
1- display larger errors (update: i think i managed to find that functionality)
2- get prettier to work
3- get a better command terminal
4- figure out tabs
5- optiona, file tree
6- fucking clipboards (update: my GOD! it finally WORKS (thx to wl-clipboard))

# logs
- okay i just figured out that <ctrl-w> in insert mode is equivalent to <ctrl-backspace> in windows...why??

# vim keybinds
here is a list of every key i use currently
h, j, k, l: left, down, up, right respectively
