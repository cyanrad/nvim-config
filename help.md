# intro
this is essentially my log while trying to learn neovim as a dev environment
currently there are a bunch of things that would be great to have including but not limited to:
1- display larger errors (update: i think i managed to find that functionality)
2- get prettier to work
3- get a better command terminal (update: figured out a way to deal w em)
4- figure out tabs (update: tabs arent that great, but figured out split screens!)
5- optiona, file tree (update: no real need for that)
6- fucking clipboards (update: my GOD! it finally WORKS (thx to wl-clipboard))
7- better under stand vim-fugitive, the git package

# logs
- okay i just figured out that <ctrl-w> in insert mode is equivalent to <ctrl-backspace> in windows...why??
- was just done with figuring out tabs and some remaps, good stuff

# vim keybinds
here is a list of every key i use currently
h, j, k, l: left, down, up, right respectively
